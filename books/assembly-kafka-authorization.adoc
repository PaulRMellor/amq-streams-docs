= Authorization

Authorization in Kafka brokers is implemented using authorizer plugins.
The default authorizer plugin uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) - a set of rules describing what uses can and cannot do.
You can supply your own authorization plugins or use the built-in _Simple ACL authorizer_.
