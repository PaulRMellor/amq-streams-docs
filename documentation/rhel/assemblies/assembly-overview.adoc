= Overview of AMQ Streams

Red Hat AMQ Streams is a massively-scalable, distributed, and high-performance data streaming platform based on the Apache ZooKeeper and Apache Kafka projects.

The main components comprise:

Kafka Broker:: Messaging broker responsible for delivering records from producing clients to consuming clients.
+
Apache ZooKeeper is a core dependency for Kafka, providing a cluster coordination service for highly reliable distributed coordination.
Kafka Streams API:: API for writing _stream processor_ applications.
Producer and Consumer APIs:: Java-based APIs for producing and consuming messages to and from Kafka brokers.
Kafka Bridge:: {ProductName} Kafka Bridge provides a RESTful interface that allows HTTP-based clients to interact with a Kafka cluster. 
Kafka Connect:: A toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems using _Connector_ plugins.
Kafka MirrorMaker:: Replicates data between two Kafka clusters, within or across data centers.
Kafka Exporter:: An exporter used in the extraction of Kafka metrics data for monitoring.

A cluster of Kafka brokers is the hub connecting all these components.
The broker uses Apache ZooKeeper for storing configuration data and for cluster coordination.
Before running Apache Kafka, an Apache ZooKeeper cluster has to be ready.
