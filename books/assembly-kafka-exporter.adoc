= Kafka Exporter

If you are using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring, you can configure Prometheus to use Kafka Exporter.

{kafka-exporter-project} is an open source project to enhance monitoring of Apache Kafka brokers and clients.
Kafka Exporter is provided with {ProductName} for deployment with a Kafka cluster to extract additional metrics data from Kafka brokers related to offsets, consumer groups, consumer lag, and topics.

The metrics data is used, for example, to help identify slow consumers.

Lag data is exposed as Prometheus metrics, which can then be presented in Grafana for analysis.
