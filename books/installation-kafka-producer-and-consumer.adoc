== Apache Kafka Producer and Consumer APIs

Kafka Producer and Consumer API are, together with Kafka AdminClient API, part of the `kafka-clients` package. The Producer API
allows applications to send data to a Kafka broker. The Consumer API allows applications to consume data from a Kafka broker.
The AdminClient API allows management of Kafka clusters (topics, brokers etc.).

The `kafka-clients` package is available in Maven. To use the APIs which are part of `kafka-clients`, following dependency should
be added:

[source]
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
    <artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
