= JMX configuration options

You configure JMX using JVM system properties.
The scripts provided with {ProductName} (`bin/kafka-server-start.sh` and `bin/connect-distributed.sh`, and so on) use the `KAFKA_JMX_OPTS` environment variable to set these system properties.
The system properties for configuring JMX are the same, even though Kafka producer, consumer, and streams applications typically start the JVM in different ways.
