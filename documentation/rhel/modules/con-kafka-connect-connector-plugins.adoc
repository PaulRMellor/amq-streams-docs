= Connector plug-ins

The following connector plug-ins are included with {ProductName}.

``FileStreamSink``
Reads data from Kafka topics and writes the data to a file.

``FileStreamSource``
Reads data from a file and sends the data to Kafka topics.

You can add more connector plug-ins if needed. Kafka Connect searches for and runs additional connector plug-ins at startup. To define the path that kafka Connect searches for plug-ins, set the ``plugin.path configuration`` option:

[source,ini]
plugin.path=/opt/kafka/connector-plugins,/opt/connectors

The ``plugin.path`` configuration option can contain a comma-separated list of paths.

When running Kafka Connect in distributed mode, plug-ins must be made available on all worker nodes.
